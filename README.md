# php_mysql_on_linux


we built public facing pages, which display database driven HTML content complete with page navigation. And we excluded subjects and pages, which should not be visible to the public. We learned to encrypt passwords and to perform and require user authentication. We nested the CRUD for our pages inside the subjects area complete with code to automatically manage their positions. In the end, we developed a respectable content management system together.

This is, of course, only the beginning. A real world content management system would use these same techniques to build even more tools. Maybe there's a database table of products and product categories, or maybe there's an area that lists recent press releases. A database could hold office locations, staff, salespeople, or job openings. The details are different for every single project, but the fundamental concepts are the same as those that we've learned in this course.
